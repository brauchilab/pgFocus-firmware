# pgFocus-firmware
Firmware to run the pgFocus Hardware

This firmware is licensed under GLP V3, June 2007.

Please contact Karl.Bellve@umassmed.edu for more information.

This is the firmware that runs the pgFocus hardware. You might need an atmel programmer
to load this firmware onto the hardware.

The one I use is called USBtinyISP AVR Programmer Kit and
can be purchased here: http://www.adafruit.com/products/46
